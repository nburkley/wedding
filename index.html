              After years of living in China, I decided to do some traveling through Central and South America. After bumping into a handsome Irish guy at the top of a volcano in Nicaragua I ended up taking a detour through Ireland. Fast-forward a few years and he's putting a ring on my finger in a hot-air balloon over the Catalan countryside.

              I had planned a three month backpacking trip through Central America. A year later I was still traveling and getting ready for a trip to Australia to meet Jo's family. A few months, later we're starting a new life in Berlin, a city I'd never even visited. Life never turns out like you'd expect, and I wouldn't change it for one second.

              After spending a quite a few years in various countries and continents, our friends are now dotted all over the world. We want to try and bring everyone together in one place and celebrate our marriage over a weekend. It may well be the only time in our lives that both our families meet. We want to make sure  that everyone get's to know each other, and we think we've found the perfect place to do so...

              <p>
              We discovered the village of <a href="http://www.aldeiadapedralva.com/en/hotel-overview.html">Aldeia da Pedralva</a> through some Portuguese friends of ours. It's a small, restored village in the middle of the countryside and we've got it all to ourselves for the whole weekend. We can get married in the town square and dance in the streets!

              This is a rough plan for the weekend. Apart from the dates (and the people getting married), nothing is set in stone - so details may vary slightly. It should still give you an idea of what to expect.

                    Don't want to leave the party just yet? We'll be heading for some time by the beach for the remainder of the week. Come join us, the Australian crew and anyone else that would like to come along for a few days of fun in sun in the Algarve. We plan to rent out some villas and soak up the sun by the beach in Alvor. Drop us a line if you're interested in joining.

              Set in the country countryside of the Algarve, the small village of Pedralva was almost in ruins a few years ago. Since 2006, the village has been completely restored with over thirty of the original cottages available.

                <h5>Accommodation</h5>
                <p>
                  The village is made up of a number of restored cottages, with a mix of one to four bedrooms. We've got the entire place reserved for the weekend, so there should be room for all, but since they're not all one-bedroom cottages some people will need to share. We'll help co-ordinate the accommodation to ensure those who wish to, can spend more time with friends and keep the costs down by sharing some of the bigger houses. Many of the cottages also include sofa-beds to give even more flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                Here are details of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="assets/accomodation-pricing.pdf">cottage options and pricing</a>. Accommodation will be available on a first come, first served basis so please <a href="#contact-form" class="inner-link" target="default">get in touch</a> with us as soon as you'd like to book.

                <h5>How do I get there?</h5>
                <p>
                The village is in the middle of the countryside - so you won't find any buses or trains nearby. It's about a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://goo.gl/NeLrn0">1 hour 15 minute drive</a> from Faro airport, or just under <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://goo.gl/UUAulh">3 hours drive</a> from Lisbon airport.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Renting a car is the easiest way to reach the village and car rental is quite reasonable at that time of year. It's also worth having a car to make the most of the area, beaches and activities on offer nearby. If that's not a option, <a href="#contact-form" class="inner-link" target="default">get in touch</a> with us and we'll if we can put you in touch with some other guests who making the trip.
